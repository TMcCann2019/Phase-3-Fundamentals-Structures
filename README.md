# Phase 3 Lecture - Python Fundamentals and Data Structures

## Welcome to our first look at Python!

## To get started:

1. Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies for the project
2. Run `pipenv shell` to enter into the project's virtual environment/shell

## We'll then start in the fundamentals.py file to introduce some basics of Python:

1. Run `python src/fundamentals.py` or `python3 src/fundamentals.py` to run the file.

## We'll then go to the data-structures.py file to introduce some basics of Python:

1. Run `python src/data-structures.py` or `python3 src/data-structures.py` to run the file.
