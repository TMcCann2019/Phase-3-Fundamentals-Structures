# Phase 3 Lecture 1: Python Fundamentals and Data Structures

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to use the Python syntax to write a variety of basic coding structures and data structures.

## Lesson Plan

0. Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.
1. Create variables in the fundamentals file.
    - What is a **variable**?
    - What are the different **scopes** you can assign to variables?
2. Write conditional statements in the fundamentals files.
    - What is a **conditional statement**?
3. Write loops in the fundamentals file.
    - What is a **for loop**? What is a **foreach loop**? What is a **while loop**?
    - What is an **infinite loop** and why would we want to avoid it?
4. Write functions in the fundamentals file.
    - What is a **function**?
    - What are **parameters** and **arguments**? What is the **return statement**?
5. Write lists in the data-structures file.
    - What is a **list**? Why don't we call it an array?
    - What is **list comprehension**?
    - What determines **mutability** vs. **immutability** for a data structure?
6. Write dictionaries in the data-structures file.
    - What is a **dictionary**?
7. Write sets in the data-structures file.
    - What is a **set**?
8. Write tuples in the data-structures file.
    - What is a **tuple**?

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lecture will introduce object-oriented programming fundamentals in Python.
